      description: Briefly describe the problem your project aims to solve
      placeholder: Traditional acoustic event detection software relies significantly on cloud processing, which results in privacy threats, latency, and poor offline performance. An urgent need exists for an end-to-end, privacy-centered solution that can detect alarms, sirens, or barks accurately in real-time directly on-deviceâ€”providing low latency, improved security, and smooth performance in low-resource or offline settings.

      placeholder: The rising demand for smart, context-aware environments inspired us to build a solution that ensures safety and accessibility through sound. Motivated by the DCASE Challenge, we aim to create a real-time, privacy-focused acoustic detection system that works even in low-resource or offline settingsâ€”bridging the gap between AI innovation and real-world usability.
