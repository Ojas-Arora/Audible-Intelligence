Acoustic Source and Event Detection: DCASE Challenge-Inspired Smart App

# üß© Assigned Problem Statement

**Project 2: A privacy-first mobile/web application that detects and identifies environmental sounds such as alarms and sirens in real time.**

Traditional acoustic event detection software relies significantly on cloud processing, which results in privacy threats, latency, and poor offline performance. An urgent need exists for an end-to-end, privacy-centered solution that can detect alarms, sirens, or barks accurately in real-time directly on-device‚Äîproviding low latency, improved security, and smooth performance in low-resource or offline settings.
Alarms, sirens, barking dogs, and other acoustic events frequently report emergencies or require urgent attention. But current sound detection systems have several basic issues that make them difficult to use in everyday life:

- **They don't work without the internet:** Most apps send sound data to servers for processing, so they stop working in offline or low-network areas.

- **They're often slow:** Sending data to the cloud and waiting for a response can cause delays‚Äîdangerous in emergencies.

- **They are too heavy for normal phones:** Some apps use complex models that take too much battery, memory, or time to work on regular devices.


To overcome these challenges, our project offers a privacy-oriented, low-latency, and on-device solution for real-time acoustic event detection. We want to solve these problems by building a simple, lightweight mobile/web app that can:

- Detect common and important sounds (like alarms, sirens, and dog barks)

- Operates completely offline or under low-resource settings

- Be fast, so users get alerts in real-time

- Supports real-world deployment on smartphones, IoT devices, or wearables

- Reliably detects important environmental sounds with high accuracy

This app can help in many real situations‚Äîlike helping people with hearing difficulties, creating smart home systems, or improving safety during emergencies. This project is motivated by the DCASE Challenge, which aims at practical acoustic scene and event detection tasks. In bringing together the latest AI into a mobile/web app, our aim is to make smarter environments possible‚Äîon use cases such as home security, elderly care, public safety systems, and accessibility devices for the hearing-impaired.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Guidelines

- Each team must **fork this repository** before starting development.
- Rename your forked repository using your **official team name**.
- Update this README in the root of your repo and include: 
  - Team members' full names and emails  
  - The assigned problem statement (already allotted)
  - A quick start guide with examples to run your code
  - Any other details if we need to know
  
- Ensure **all code, documentation, and related work is committed to your forked repository**. 
- Make **regular commits** throughout the program. Your commit history will be considered during the evaluation to assess collaboration and progress.
- Each team is required to create an issue in the repository using the `aisoc-workspace` issue template. This issue must include the following details:

  - Team information  
  - Project title and problem statement  
  - Timeline with clear milestones  
  - Expected outcomes and deliverables  

All project-related discussions, updates, and queries must be conducted within this issue thread to ensure transparency and open collaboration across teams.

## Final Submission Guidelines

Please carefully follow the instructions below to ensure successful completion and evaluation of your project:

1. **Working Demo**  
   - Before the final submission, you must include a working demo of your project.  
   - The demo should clearly explain the problem statement and how your solution addresses it.  
   - Upload your project to a shared location (e.g., Google Drive) and include the access link.

2. **Presentation Requirement**  
   - You are required to prepare a brief presentation detailing your solution.  
   - This presentation must be delivered **offline** to the evaluation panel.  
   - The presentation will be scheduled towards the end of July.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**  
   - Your final evaluation and the issuance of a certificate of completion will be based on:
     - Submission of a working demo with a clear explanation.
     - A shared drive link to your project.
     - A completed offline presentation to the panel.
   - Any changes or deviations from these requirements must be discussed and approved by the program staff.  
   - Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in termination of your contract.

Please ensure all deliverables are ready and submitted according to the above criteria.
